<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 [Decode a Morse code message] <a name="about-project"></a>

During your vacation at the seaside, time after time you find old bottles with parchment inside. Out of curiosity, you look into the next bottle and see that there is a message written in Morse code. Morse code is a method used in telecommunication to encode text characters as standardized sequences of two different signal durations, called dots and dashes, or dits and dahs. However, you are getting tired of decrypting messages manually. This program in Ruby can help by automating this process.
